My personal site and portfolio. Made with NextJS and TypeScript

bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Deployed as a static site using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Todo

- [ ] Use a lib for svg icons (or get from a cdn)
- [ ] Migrate to next.js 13.4, to app router and React Server Components
- [ ] Add i18n with english version
- [ ] Update tech stack (aws, trpc, RSC)
